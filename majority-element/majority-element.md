# Majority element

Source: [LeetCode: 169](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 *` $10⁴$
- $-10^9$ `<= nums1[i], nums2[j]` $-10^9$ 

## Follow up
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
